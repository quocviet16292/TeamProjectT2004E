        <h3>HelloBeauty Service</h3>
        <p>
            HelloBeauty is a platform that connects beauticians (individually or collectively beauty service vendors) providing “Beauty Services”:
            make up, hair, eyebrow embroidery, eyelash extension, beauty class and other beauty services with clients seeking such services.
            The Beautician and Clients are both users of the service provided by HelloBeauty.
        </p>
        <p>
            HelloBeauty solely provides a platform for Beauticians and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision
            of Beauty Services. HelloBeauty does not provide or contract for Beauty Services, and Beauticians and Clients contract independently
            for the provision of Beauty Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Beautician, the Beauty Services to be provided
            and the location at which Beauty Services will be performed, whether on the premises of a Beautician or at a site designated by the Client.
            Any decision by a Client to receive Beauty Services or by a Beautician to provide Beauty Services is a decision made in such person's sole
            discretion and at their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and
            (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and Beauticians.
        </p>
        <p>
            HelloBeauty does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any
            other aspect whatsoever of any Beauty Services provided by Beauticians nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions
            whatsoever of any Beauticians or Clients. HelloBeauty makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Beauty Services offered or
            provided by Beauticians or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the
            accreditation, registration or licensing of any Beautician. You understand that HelloBeauty does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the
            background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. HelloBeauty does not verify or confirm that any User is who they
            claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Beauty Services on the Services.
            HelloBeauty does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, HelloBeauty may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Beauticians via third-party background
            check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check,
            and may terminate a Beautician based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not HelloBeauty
            conducts a background check or first party interview on a Beautician, each Client must decide whether a Beautician is suited to such Client's needs and
            should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know.
            NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY
            RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
            ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.
